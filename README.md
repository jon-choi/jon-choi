# Jonathan Choi

## Welcome to my GitHub! üëã  

I'm a newly minted full-stack developer who recently graduated from the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. My background lies in the food service industry where I worked as a chef in Vancouver, BC. I also attended the University of Victoria where I graduated with a degree in Sociology, with a focus on Law and Social Control, as well as Pop Culture and Media. 

When I'm not coding or working on projects you can find me:

  Making music with Ableton Live üéπ    
  Jamming on guitar üé∏ 
  Playing hockey üèí 
  Golfing üèåÔ∏è
  Climbing üßó

I am currently working as a Front End Developer Intern at Buoyancy Works in Calgary, AB.
